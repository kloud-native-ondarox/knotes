# Welcome to Kloud Native Knotes Brain Dump Site

For years, I've caught most - if not all my notes in local repos with Markdown. Guess I
finally decide to drop into public repo...

This site is just a collection of Markdown files filled with random comments, 
code snippets, best practices I had captured while walking through demos, troubleshooting sessions, 
educational walkthroughs or from reading - do with it what you want.
